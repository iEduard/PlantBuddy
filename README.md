# PlantBuddy

Buddy that helps you out with your plants


## Hardware


- Arduino Nano
- Capacitive moisture sensor
- 8x8 Bicolor LED matrix 
- BH1750 Digital light sensor



### LED Matrix

LED Matrix from Adafruit: https://www.adafruit.com/product/902

In order to improve the performance we use this Library to control the LED-Matrix. The ht16k33.py and the ht16k33matrixcolour.py Files are needed in order to function properly.

With this Library we also need the blinka library from Adafruit. To install the Library you can use pip.
But still needs the blinka library from Adafruit

> sudo pip3 install adafruit-blinka



### Light Sensor
