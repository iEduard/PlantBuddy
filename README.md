### Distance sensor

In order to dedect presence we will use the ultrasonic sensor.

### LED Matrix

The used LED Matrix is from Adafruit: https://www.adafruit.com/product/902
It is an 8x8 Bi Color LED Matrix. So you can display three colors red, yellow and green.

The Adafruit implementation for python causes slow response for the matrix. You are only able to set pixel by pixel.
In order to improve the performance we use this Library to control the LED-Matrix. The ht16k33.py and the ht16k33matrixcolour.py Files are needed in order to function properly.

With this Library we also need the blinka library from Adafruit. To install the Library you can use pip.

> sudo pip3 install adafruit-blinka


### Light sensor

The Fritzing file was downloaded here:

Library found here: [Link](https://gist.github.com/oskar456/95c66d564c58361ecf9f)

Will be used with the SMBUS Library

> pip3 install smbus

###Â Temp Humidity Sensor

Using the DHT Library

Some Infos from websites
- [Link1](https://www.pi-shop.ch/temperatur-und-feuchtigkeitssensor)
- [Link2](https://learn.adafruit.com/dht/using-a-dhtxx-sensor)

Used library is from Adafruit: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DHT


To Install the library use pip:

> pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-dht

## Software

The Software is written in Python. 

In order to control the devices you need to enable the I2C Interface on the Raspberry Pi.
