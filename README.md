### Moisture sensor

Capacitive moisture sensor with an analog output.
Here is a tutorial from the net.

#### ADC Converter

In order to use the capacitive sensor with the raspberry pi zero we need analog to digital converter.
Library and examples for the dac board can be found here [LibDoku](https://github.com/pimoroni/ads1015-python)

### Distance sensor

In order to dedect presence we will use the ultrasonic sensor.
Here is a tutorial from the net:

### LED Matrix

The used LED Matrix is from Adafruit: https://www.adafruit.com/product/902
It is an 8x8 Bi Color LED Matrix. So you can display three colors red, yellow and green.

The Adafruit implementation for python causes slow response for the matrix. You are only able to set pixel by pixel.
In order to improve the performance we use this Library to control the LED-Matrix. The ht16k33.py and the ht16k33matrixcolour.py Files are needed in order to function properly.

With this Library we also need the blinka library from Adafruit. To install the Library you can use pip.

> sudo pip3 install adafruit-blinka


### Light sensor

The Fritzing file was downloaded here:
http://omnigatherum.ca/wp/?p=338

Library found here: [Link](https://gist.github.com/oskar456/95c66d564c58361ecf9f)

Will be used with the SMBUS Library

> pip3 install smbus

###Â Temp Humidity Sensor

Using the DHT Library

Some Infos from websites
- [Link1](https://www.pi-shop.ch/temperatur-und-feuchtigkeitssensor)
- [Link2](https://learn.adafruit.com/dht/using-a-dhtxx-sensor)

Used library is from Adafruit: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DHT


To Install the library use pip:

> pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-dht

## Software

The Software is written in Python. 

In order to control the devices you need to enable the I2C Interface on the Raspberry Pi.

### Install Dependencies





# Pi Konfiguration

After installing the latest Raspbian OS from RaspberryPi.org update the systenm by:

sudo apt-get update
> 
>$ sudo apt-get upgrade

## Install the requested libraries

>$ pip install fritzconnection adafruit-circuitpython-mcp4725 netifaces


## Create and start service

Source: https://www.nerdynat.com/programming/2019/run-python-on-your-raspberry-pi-as-background-service/

```sh
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/PlantBuddy.service
```

Add the text from ./Software/PlantBuddy.service
Than change the permission

```sh
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/PlantBuddy.service
```

Reload the system manager configuration

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Start the Service

```sh
sudo systemctl start PlantBuddy.service
```


Enable the service to start at boot 

```sh
sudo systemctl enable PlantBuddy.service
```

So stop the service you can use

```sh
sudo systemctl stop PlantBuddy.service
```


# Data aggregation

Data will be read from the Xiaomi Plant Sensor.

## Required Software

To install PostgresSQL on MacOS with brew use:

```sh
brew install postgresql@14
```

To install PostgresSql on the Raspberry Pi use:

```sh
sudo su postgres
```
